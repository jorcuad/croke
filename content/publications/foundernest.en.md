description: 'Cybersecurity may be something complex to define when you are an SME. It is even harder if you must plan it inside a budget because of its economic cost. In this talk, I introduce cybersecurity focusing in which objectives should be implemented first and which ones, I think, have better cost-efficiency in the security and resiliency of the company.'
