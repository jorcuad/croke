## Croke v2
This is the second version of my personal web page. This web was created using GatsbyJS, TailwindCSS, Storybook and Styled Components.

I started with zero knowledge about these technologies. I heard about them and I decided learning how to use them in a practical way. After many hours and research this personal blog, portfolio and personal web page... this is the result.

The hosting and maintenance of this web is totally free. I use Netlify to serve the statics of this page that is automatically deployed with each commit in the master branch.

This web page is a personal project that I want to use as a sandbox. I will update the components and designs of the web page in order to learn about new technologies.
